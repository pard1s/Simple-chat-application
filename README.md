Simple chat application using socket programming - C#
I have used SimpleTCP library for this project and you can read more about this library in: https://github.com/BrandonPotter/SimpleTCP
first run and start the server. then you can create multiple instances of clinet which can chat together. for login you can use usernames below:

  *username   *password
   pardis      pardis
   user1       user1
   user2       user2
   admin       admin
   
you can also create new users using sign up button. once you login you can see "connected to the server" in log pannel, then you can send messages to other users.
