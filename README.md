Simple chat application using socket programming - C#

I have used SimpleTCP library for this project and you can read more about this library in: https://github.com/BrandonPotter/SimpleTCP
first run and start the server. then you can create multiple instances of clinet which can chat together. for login you can use usernames below:

*username -> *password

  pardis  ->   pardis
  
  user1   ->  user1
  
  user2   ->   user2
  
  admin   ->   admin
   
you can also create new users using sign up button. once you login you can see "connected to the server" in log pannel, then you can send messages to other users.
